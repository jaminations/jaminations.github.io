# About Me

Hello! I am James, although I go by JamJam. Animation means a lot to me. It's one of the things I am truly proud of in my life seeing as I've accomplished amazing goals just through animation. It's practically the only thing that I've been thinking for the past few months and my focus is placed solely on it.

I'm an experienced animator who strives to improve with every animation. I have over 2 years of experience and I've worked with mutliple big names such as Stand Proud, Rolve and Ultimate tower defense. 

I'm very driven and never give up on tasks. If I'm given a task, I must finish it before letting myself rest - As an animator, it is my duty to deliver fast and quality animations to my customers.

Regarding my animations, I would consider them fairly high quality. There's always a high amount of effort put in making these - Afterall, it is my job and my passion. As stated before, I'm efficient. One time I even managed to deliver more than 12 fairly detailed animations in one day. I'm also quite **versatile**. I can animate custom rigs, R15 and R6 as well as weapons.

I believe that's all you should know about me. My commissions are always open and I'm eager to work with you.
